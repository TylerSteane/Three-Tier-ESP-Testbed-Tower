# Three-Tier-ESP-Testbed-Tower
This project enables the rapid mass programming of many ESP01 devices using a three-tiered approach, for research into IoT protocol design and testing and similar areas. Up-to15 ESP's can be connected to each Testbed tower and many towers can be used in combination to accommodate networks of any size.   Provided here are the hardware schematics and the PCB layout as well as the code.
